Freeplane is an actively maintained open-source project. Some limitations are known but cannot be resolved easily due to technical or external constraints.

You can find such issues collected under the following labels on GitHub:

👉 [All “can’t do”, “not our bug”, and “wontfix” issues](https://github.com/freeplane/freeplane/issues?q=label%3A%22can%27t%20do%22%20OR%20label%3A%22not%20our%20bug%22%20OR%20label%3Awontfix)

We maintain these labels to be transparent about problems that are currently out of scope for fixing.

## What the labels mean

- **`can't do`** – The issue is technically impossible to fix within current architecture or Java/Swing limitations.
- **`not our bug`** – The issue is caused by external libraries, the operating system, or Java itself.
- **`wontfix`** – We acknowledge the issue, but intentionally won't fix it — due to design choices, complexity, or impact.

These labels are used to keep the issue tracker clean and transparent.
